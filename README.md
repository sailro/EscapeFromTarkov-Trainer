*I'm not responsible for any consequences that result from using this code. BattleState / BattlEye will ban you if you try to use it 'live'.*

***TLDR => Use the [Universal Installer](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/releases).*** Default key for in-game GUI is `Right-Alt`.

This is an attempt -for educational purposes only- to alter a Unity game at runtime without patching the binaries (so without using [Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) nor [Reflexil](https://github.com/sailro/reflexil)).

`master` branch can build against `EFT 0.13.0.21734` (tested with [`spt-aki Version 3.5.0`](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/16-spt-aki/#versions)). If you are looking for another version, see [`branches`](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/branches) and [`releases`](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/releases).

> If you want to compile the code yourself, make sure you cleaned-up your solution properly after upgrading your EFT/sptarkov bits (even removing `bin` and `obj` folders) and check all your references.

> If you are using `SPT-AKI`, please make sure you have run the game at least once before compiling/installing the trainer. `SPT-AKI` is patching binaries during the first run, and we need to compile against those patched binaries.

> The typical issue when something is out of sync is that the game will freeze at the startup screen with type/tokens errors in `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Battlestate Games\EscapeFromTarkov\Player.log`

## Easy and automatic installation

Simply use the [Universal Installer](https://github.com/sailro/EscapeFromTarkov-Trainer/releases).

## Manual installation 

You can try to compile the code yourself (you will need a recent Visual Studio, because we are using CSharp 9). You can use a precompiled release as well.

Copy all files in your EFT directory like `C:\Battlestate Games\EFT`:

- `EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed\NLog.EFT.Trainer.dll` (this is the compiled code for the trainer)
- `EscapeFromTarkov_Data\outline` (this is the dedicated shader we use to outline players [wallhack])

### If you are using the Live version (you should NOT do that, you'll be detected and banned):

Rename `EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed\NLog.dll.nlog-live` to `NLog.dll.nlog`. This will work only for legacy versions. Given EscapeFromTarkov `0.13.0.21531` or later prevent this trainer to be loaded using NLog configuration. It is now mandatory to use SPT-AKI/BepInEx for recent versions.

### If you are using sptarkov (https://www.sp-tarkov.com):

Overwrite the existing `EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed\NLog.dll.nlog` using `NLog.dll.nlog-sptarkov`, or update the existing file accordingly. We must include the following 
`<target name="EFTTarget" xsi:type="EFTTarget" />` in the `targets` section for the trainer to be loaded properly. This is for legacy versions before EscapeFromTarkov `0.13.0.21531`.

For newer versions, copy `aki-efttrainer.dll` (this is the compiled code for the BepInEx plugin) to `BepInEx\plugins`.

## Configuration

![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638167/149630825-7d76b102-0836-4eb9-a27f-d33fb519452f.png)
